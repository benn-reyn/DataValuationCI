Risk Valuation Model

Estimates expected data breach losses via:
    E[Loss] = P(Breach) × L(Impact)
    
using Monte Carlo simulation with empirically-calibrated priors.

Architecture:
    - BreachProbabilityModel: Estimates breach probability from size + security rating
    - ImpactEstimationModel: Estimates conditional loss magnitude via multi-signal fusion
    - MonteCarloValuation: Propagates uncertainty through joint simulation

Key Design Decisions:
    - Precision-weighted fusion: Combines signals inversely proportional to variance
    - Log-normal impact: Captures right-skewed loss distributions observed empirically
    - Gaussian copula: Induces realistic correlation between P and L

    Joint simulation of breach probability and impact with correlation.
    
    Methodology:
        1. Sample P(Breach) from size+rating fusion model
        2. Sample L(Impact) from multi-signal fusion model
        3. Induce correlation via Gaussian copula
        4. Compute E[Loss] = P × L distribution
        
    Correlation Rationale:
        Empirical evidence suggests P and L exhibit positive correlation
        (ρ ≈ 0.25-0.35): firms with higher breach probability also tend
        to suffer larger impacts due to poorer incident response.
        
    WARNING: Improper correlation can cause explosive or collapsed losses.
    Always validate with scatter plots and sanity checks against benchmarks.
